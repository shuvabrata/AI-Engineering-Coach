# Supported Tools

AI Engineer Coach reads local log files from the following AI coding assistants. No network requests are made; all data stays on your machine.

## Local Agent (VS Code and VS Code Insiders)

The primary harness. AI Engineer Coach parses the chat panel logs that GitHub Copilot writes to the VS Code extension host log directory. This captures every request, response, model used, token counts, tool calls, file references, and terminal commands.

When VS Code connects through Remote-WSL, Remote-SSH, or a Dev Container, the logs live on the remote host under `~/.vscode-server/data/User/workspaceStorage/` (or `~/.vscode-server-insiders/data/User/workspaceStorage/` for Insiders) and appear in the dashboard as `Local Agent (Server)` or `Local Agent (Server Insiders)`.

Newer VS Code / Copilot Chat builds write sessions as `GitHub.copilot-chat/transcripts/*.jsonl` instead of `chatSessions/*.json`; both formats are read automatically. The transcript format has no `workspace.json` sidecar, so the workspace folder shown in the dashboard is inferred from the files those sessions edited — sessions that only read files (e.g. via a subagent) may show up under the raw workspace-storage id instead of the repo name.

**What is tracked:**
- Requests and responses with timestamps
- Model selection (e.g., `claude-opus-4.6`, `gpt-5.4`, `auto`) — not available for `transcripts/*.jsonl` sessions, which don't record model or token usage
- Tool calls and slash commands used
- File context references (`#file`, open editor tabs)
- Terminal command execution
- Turn-by-turn conversation structure

## Claude

Parses session files from Anthropic's Claude CLI tool. Each session is read as a structured conversation with tool use, file edits, and terminal commands.

## Codex

Reads session history from OpenAI's Codex terminal agent. Captures prompts, completions, and tool interactions.

## OpenCode

Parses session logs from the open-source OpenCode terminal tool that supports multiple LLM backends.

## GitHub Copilot for Xcode

Reads Copilot Chat conversation logs from Apple's Xcode IDE. Sessions are parsed from SQLite databases stored in the GitHub Copilot configuration directory.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

Parses session state and history files from the GitHub Copilot CLI terminal agent. Captures prompts, completions, model usage, and per-model token metrics reported at session shutdown.

## Workspace Filtering

You can filter analytics to a single workspace or view aggregated data across all workspaces. The bottom-left panel in the UI provides workspace and harness selectors.
